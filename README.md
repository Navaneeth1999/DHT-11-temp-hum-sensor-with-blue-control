# DHT-11-temp-hum-sensor-with-blue-control

In this article, we interface The DHT11  temperature and humidity sensor is commonly used in college projects to find out the temperature and humidity of the environment. The sensor logic output is in digital format and is required only 5v. we will just interface the DHT11 Sensor with Arduino
